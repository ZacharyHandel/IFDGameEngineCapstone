# IFDGameEngineCapstone
This repository holds all the files related to me and my team member's code regarding our final capstone project for our Data Structures and Algorithms class.

## Developers:
- Zachary Handel, Zachary West, Gavin Hopper.

## Description:
- This project was created over the span of roughly 4 months (the majority of the course). All of these parts can be found in my repository "CS-355". You will find each checkpoint of the project by searching for the files labeled 'Project 1','Project 2',Project 3', and 'Project 4'. To see all related commits to the final capstone project, find 'Project 4' within the 'CS-355' repoisitory. This repository is created in order to bring emphasis to the creation of this project. 
- This project consists of me and my team members to add new features to an already-created game engine created by Dr. Daniel Ray. The game engine holds the functionality of reading off of a file labeled as a 'interactive fiction document' file (or .ifd). An example of an ifd file can be found within this repository. With this game engine, users can create a .ifd file that can then be read by the game engine in order to create an interactive game within the console of your computer (a C++ compiler is required to build and run the program).

## My contribution:
- My part of the project consisted of creating a randomized combat system. I added the functionality of the user having the ability to create areas within their map that can be labeled as 'combat' or 'non-combat' areas. If the area is labeled 'combat', then the player will have to go through the combat event that I created.
- The combat event works like this: The player is given an option to choose between 1,2, or 3. If they choose the correct number, then they deal damage to the enemy. Otherwise, the player will take damage. 
##How to Run
1. Download [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
2. Run mainIFD.cpp with g++
```bash
g++ mainIFD.cpp -o output
```

## Conclusion:
- This project put my Object-Oriented-Programming skills to the test through examples of polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. I also learned skills related to working with a team of people in order to create a program and the process of putting different people's code together to create the final product.
